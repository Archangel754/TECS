# TECS
The software implementation half of The Elements of Computing Systems by Nisan and Schocken.

This is my implementation of the second half of the Nand to Tetris
book, beginning with the assembler and continuing on to a functioning
VM, compiler, and OS. I have completed the design and simulation of
the hardware components of the HACK computer platform, but everything
can also be run on the simulators provided by the book's authors.
